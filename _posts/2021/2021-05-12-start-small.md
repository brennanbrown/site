Start Small

There’s so much pressure to outshine everyone else — to be the most interesting person in conversation — but it’s all so ridiculous.

I’ve never cared about anybody that proudly lists their accolades, how fascinating your life amounts to doesn’t really mean anything. You’ll be a skeleton, too.

These are things that I need to remind myself of — that I don’t need to have a breakthrough each time I venture out to start something.

*Relax, already* — have some fun with it. If you aren’t willing to, then who will?

There’s no reason not to enjoy the cozyness of the middleplace. The perfect adequacy of a small garden over a complex & large orchid meadows.

So, start small. Do what makes you feel good, and then stop when it doesn’t. Take breaks often with delight. Stay small, if you’d like. As long as you’re doing something that’s helping others, or has a good meaningfulness behind it, that’s all that really matters — right?
